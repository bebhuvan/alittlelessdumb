# ðŸ“š Someday Stack

*My "I'll read this someday" pile (spoiler: someday rarely comes)*

The digital equivalent of that growing stack of books on your nightstand. You know, the ones you bought with the best intentions but somehow never quite get around to reading. At least here I can pretend it's organized.
