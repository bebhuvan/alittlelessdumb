# Link Blackhole

Welcome to the event horizon of my digital curiosity — that mysterious realm where bookmarks, reading lists, and "I'll definitely check this out later" links vanish into the void. 

Books to read, courses to take, articles to dive into, skills to master — all swirling in this gravitational pull of infinite procrastination and genuine fascination.

*Where the speed of saving exceeds the speed of reading.*
