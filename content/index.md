title: Welcome

Hi, my name is **Bhuvan**—welcome to my garden of tentative thoughts. This little corner of the internet is where I
share interesting links, jot quick notes, and think out loud about ideas that sometimes grow into longer essays on
[Substack](https://bhuvan.substack.com).

You'll also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bebhuvan/) and
[Twitter](https://x.com/bebhuvan).

I also send out whatever I write as a newsletter. So, if you’d like to add another newsletter to the list of newsletters you’ve already subscribed to but *aren’t* reading, mine qualifies. Subscribe on [Substack](https://bhuvan.substack.com) and it will land in your inbox.
