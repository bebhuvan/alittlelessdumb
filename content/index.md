title: "Welcome to A Little Less Dumb"

Hi, I'm **Bhuvan**—welcome to my digital brain spillage. This chaotic corner of the internet serves as my external memory, where I dump interesting links, half-formed thoughts, stolen wisdom from things I consume, and the occasional attempt at coherent writing.

Think of it as my personal Pocket/Instapaper mixed with a stream-of-consciousness journal. Sometimes these scattered thoughts grow into longer pieces on [Substack](https://bhuvan.substack.com), but mostly they just live here in their natural, unpolished state.

You can also find me overthinking things on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bebhuvan/) and [Twitter](https://x.com/bebhuvan).

## Newsletter & RSS

I occasionally send out the more coherent bits as a newsletter. If you'd like to add another newsletter to your ever-growing collection of subscriptions you'll never read, mine is perfectly suited for that purpose. Subscribe on [Substack](https://bhuvan.substack.com) and it will join the others gathering digital dust in your inbox.
