It’s a tricky question, partly because reading and writing are deeply individual pursuits. What they mean to one person can be completely different for someone else.

That said, here’s how I see it.

LLMs are already changing the way people consume content. More people are using them to summarize long-form pieces they might otherwise have read. But it’s also possible those same people wouldn’t have read the full piece in the first place. So it’s hard to say whether the overall effect is negative.

What we do know is that there are early signs of people reading within LLMs. Instead of visiting original websites, they’re consuming summaries and explanations inside the chat interface. This shift is also affecting search traffic. Rather than clicking through to websites, users often get their answers directly in the form of AI-generated blurbs.

Now, will LLMs change how we read and write? I think it depends on what reading and writing mean to the individual.

For many people, reading—especially books—has become a kind of performance. It’s not always about discovery or reflection. It’s about being seen reading. Sharing that you’re reading a certain author. Posting aesthetic photos of your book and coffee cup. Broadcasting a curated intellectual identity.

For me, it’s never really been about that. I used to read in search of wisdom or life-changing insights. But over time, I’ve come to think of books more as both a mirror and a portal. A mirror because they help you notice things in yourself or the world you might have ignored. A portal because they open doors to ideas and places you never would have imagined.

So yes, if reading is just performative, LLMs might completely upend that. But for those who genuinely love the act of reading itself, I don’t think much will change.

Can LLMs change the form of reading? Absolutely. For example, imagine a future Kindle where you can have a live conversation with an LLM about the book you’re reading. That would fundamentally reshape the reading experience. And that’s just one possible direction—there are likely to be many more we can’t even imagine yet.

As for writing, again, it depends on what writing means to you.

Like reading, writing has become performative for many. People write to go viral, to be known, to please an audience. The writing itself often gets reduced to optimization—SEO hacks, clickbait titles, growth tricks.

That’s never been my reason for writing. Of course, it feels good when people read and share what I write. But even if only a few people read it, I’d still keep writing. Writing is how I understand the world. It’s how I think. It’s how I frame ideas and ask better questions. My favorite way to describe it is: reading helps me understand the shape of my own ignorance.

Even with LLMs, my reading habits haven’t fundamentally changed. If anything, I’m reading more books and long-form essays than before. The LLM just acts as a companion. When I read something difficult, I still try to get through it on my own first. But then I’ll use the LLM to clarify, contextualize, or explore related ideas. In that sense, it’s like having a reasonably smart friend in your pocket at all times—someone who knows a lot about a lot.

That’s a powerful thing. But it's also a trade-off. Using LLMs isn’t free of cost. It changes how we interact with content, and those choices come with consequences.

For people who read or write for external validation—for likes, shares, and recognition—LLMs may fundamentally alter their relationship with both. The dopamine feedback loop weakens when fewer people visit sites or engage with the original content.

But for people like me, not much has changed. I still read. I still write. And I’m using these tools to help me do both, better. I’m also experimenting with AI-assisted writing, co-writing, and more. It’s an exciting space to play in—not a replacement, but a companion.
