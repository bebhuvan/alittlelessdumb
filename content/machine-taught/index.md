# ðŸ¤– Machine-Taught

*What happens when human curiosity collides with artificial intelligence?*

This collection captures my learning sessions with AI companions - those moments when I dive deep into a topic, ask relentless questions, and emerge with new understanding. Each post shares the raw conversation, complete with my confused questions, the AI's patient explanations, and those beautiful "aha!" moments.

Think of it as **public learning in progress** - unpolished, genuine, and hopefully useful to fellow curious minds who learn by watching others stumble toward understanding.

**What you'll find here:**
- ðŸ’¬ Raw AI conversation transcripts  
- ðŸ§  Learning breakthroughs and mental models
- ðŸ¤” The messy process of grappling with new concepts
- ðŸ“š Topics I'm genuinely curious about (not just trending ones)

*Because the best learning happens in dialogue, even if your conversation partner is made of math.*
