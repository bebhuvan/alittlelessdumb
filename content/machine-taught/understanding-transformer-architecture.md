# Understanding Transformer Architecture

*A deep dive into the building blocks of modern AI*

## The Conversation

**Me:** I keep hearing about transformers being the foundation of modern AI, but I don't really understand what makes them special. Can we break this down from first principles?

**Claude:** Absolutely! Let's start with the core insight that makes transformers powerful...

[Conversation continues with detailed explanations, code examples, and breakthrough moments]

## Key Takeaways

- **Attention is all you need** - The famous paper title makes sense now
- **Parallelization** - Unlike RNNs, transformers can process sequences in parallel
- **Self-attention** - The ability for each position to attend to all positions
- **Scalability** - Architecture scales beautifully with more data and compute

## What I Want to Explore Next

- How does attention work in vision transformers?
- What are the computational bottlenecks?
- Can we visualize what different attention heads are "looking at"?
